        This simple script iterates through the
        available data.  It places the files in the

		Update : my local network was timing out overnight.  To KISS 
		I added a explicit list of all the files.  This py script 
		('NetCDF_Flint2014_future_list.py') is configured to grab
		ALL parameters, ALL scenarios - it should be elementary to 
		copy'n'paste a subset if you'd like.
